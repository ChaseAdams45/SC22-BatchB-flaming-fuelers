All of the layers that we are using for this are fully connected layers. The input size is 28 by 28 because we are flattening out the 28 by 28 image into 28*28=784 numbers. We are adding a activation function ReLU after that. ReLU(x) = max(x,0) so relu turns negative values to zero and positive values stay the same. \n\nAfter the first layer, we take the number of outputs of the first layer as the number of inputs into the second layer. And an arbitrary number of outputs for the second layer that we decide. \n\nNotice how we have an activation function after each layer. \n\nThen the third layer you code yourself, view the instructions below. \n\nFinally, we have an output activation function. The 10 numbers that are outputted from our previous layer can be any numbers from negative infinity to infinity. We want every class output to be from zero to one, like a probability. The softmax activation function turns the output into a probability for each class. ","metadata":{"id":"QtFMastrDkvf"},"pos":16,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
